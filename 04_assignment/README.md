# 04Assignment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.0.

## Tasks

* Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even

* The GameControl Component should have buttons to start and stop the game

* When starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number) should get emitted each second (ref=setInterval())

* The event should be listenable from outside the component

* When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clearInterval(ref))

* A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted, the same should happen for the Even Component (on even numbers)

* Simply output odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two components

* Style the element (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text differently in both components
