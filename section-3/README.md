# Section 3, angular modules

In this section we will learn about angular modules.

Despite the section 2 where we used the standalone components which is a new feature that came with angular @17.

In this section we will take the mini project from section 2 and replace the standalone components with angular modules dependencies.

During the course I will add more details about the process in code files, as comments.


I found important to mention that the modules can work with standalone components and vice versa.


However nowadays it is not recommended to use the modules specially if a new project is developed since angular @17 version. But it's important to know this way too, sometimes are situations where the modules are used this section can be useful.
