# Section-4 Time to practice

This section contains a miniproject where we put on practice the essentials learned in the previous sections.

IMPORTANT: in this section I will not use anymore Angular modules anymore, instead will be used only the standalone components.
Explanation: Based on my future projects which are planned, I will use angular versions upper than @17.

That's why I completed the section-3. If are cases where the project is old and modules are needed then in section-3 can be found examples.

Also what will not be covered in this section are the signals, but I left some comments how should be used if will be the case in future, and the services, because for now I found them obsolete. But in the future I will complete this as should be.
